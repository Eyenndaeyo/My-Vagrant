#Every file and directory in Linux has:
Owner (user who owns the file)
Group (group that can access the file)
Permissions (what each can do: read, write, execute)

The part: -rwxr-xr-- is the permission string:
r	Read	Can view the file
w	Write	Can modify the file
x	Execute	Can run the file (scripts)
-	No permission	

rwx → Owner: read, write, execute
r-x → Group: read, execute (but can’t write)
r-- → Others: read-only
